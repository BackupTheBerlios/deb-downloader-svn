 OVERVIEW
~~~~~~~~~~

	This is an utility written by me called deb-downloader, a tool implemented 
for an specific GNU/Linux distro called Debian (or Debian based distros). deb-downloader 
was written two month ago (06-08-2004) , when my "high speed" internet connection was down because of 
my house moving. This event made think me about which was the only way for upgrading my 
Sid (Debian has three versions (stable, testing and sid also called Sid (an urban legend 
says it means System In Development)).

	I had heard about a Debian tool called apt-zip, but I didn't have a GNU/Linux distro at
work so I decide to write this tool. deb-downloader is written in Perl, so the only requirement 
for its use is having an operating system with a perl interpreter as *nix systems, Macintosh
(OS 7-9 and X), VMS, Windows, etc. (see http://www.cpan.org/ports/index.html for more details).

	I hope it will be useful for everybody who use it.
	

 REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	There are two requirements for using deb-downloader.
	
		- Debian GNU/Linux (or Debian based distro) for build and install deb-downloader option.
		- Perl interpreter (with ftp and http modules).

 USE
~~~~~

This script is divided in three parts (as you can imagine). The first and the third one are executed in a 
Debian distro and the second one in a machine with any operating system containing a perl interpreter.

This are the three options (or parts, as you like) :

	- build : This option is used for recollect all the .deb uris needed for downloading the packages. 
		  This option is executed in a Debian distro.

		deb-downloader --option=build [-d|--debug] --file=filename [--skip-update]
		

	- download : This is used for download the .deb packages needed. It can be executed in any computer 
		     with any operating system with a perl interpreter.
				 
		deb-downloader --option=download [-d|--debug] --file=filename [--dd-root=directory]
				 
	- install : This option is used for install the packages into the /var/cache/apt/archives and, if you want, 
		    execute apt-get dist-upgrade.
		
		deb-downloader --option=install [-d|--debug] --file=filename [--mirror-format] [--dd-root=directory] [--execute-dist-upgrade]
